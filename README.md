[Inprogress]

Project to predict the match between two faces

[Progress as of 8/Aug/2023]

Moved away from the TinyVGG model architecture to the pre-trained VGG16 model to get better face embedding.
Mostly it works if we keep the threshold to 70% similarity.

[Next step]

Moving from VGG16 to FaceNet or to OpenFace to get a better face feature embedding
