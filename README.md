[Inprogress]

[Progress as of 8/Aug/2023]

Moved away from the TinyVGG architecture to the pre-trained VGG16 weights to get better feature embedding.
Mostly it works if we keep the threshold to 70% similarity.

[Next step]

Moving from VGG16 to FaceNet or to OpenFace weights to get a better facial feature embedding
